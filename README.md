# Senses
For Hack the North 2019 we created a mobile app that lets you take a photo and receive a quick audio and text response of the content of the photo in the language of your choice.

We wanted to give people a new way to learn languages. Since we both come from international families, we believed in something that would help new people in a foreign country.

Having just met this weekend, we were able to form a team and finish the complete project within 24 hours. This was a great experience for our first hackathon!

## How we built it
The app is built using the javascript framework for mobile apps, react-native. We used a flask server as well as the google apis (vision, speech, translate) to process the user requests from the app.
